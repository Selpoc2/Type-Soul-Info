       <h1>How to rank up as a Soul Reaper</h1>
       <br>     
       <br>
        <h2>Trainee-Grade 3</h2>
       
        <p>Once you spawn in, you will be teleported to the Soul Society, you can grind here until Grade 5 and you will get the
        <br>
        "Senkaimon" which will teleport you to Karakura Town, though it is recommended to keep farming in the Soul
        <br>
        Society by interacting with the Quest Boards.
        <br>
        <br>
        After you reach Grade 3, you will be required to join a Division to continue grading up. You can find them at the
        <br>
        Soul Society by pressing the , button (next to the M key) . Here is a list of the Divisions and what each of them do
        <br>
        (division quests that asks you to do thing at Karakura/Rukon will teleport you there, and then you'll need to find a
        <br>
        Division Duty board)
        <br>
        <br>
        RECOMMENDATION: For an easier time grinding from Grade 3 up to Grade 2, go into Division 12(easiest one).
        <br><br><br> <h2>Grade 3-2</h2>

        Once you join a Division, to rank up from Grade 3 to Semi-Grade 2, just continue with normal quests board. You
        <br>
        should also try out your Division Quest to get a feel of how hard it is. These can be found somewhere throughout
        <br>
        your Division and should be left of the normal quest board inside. If you feel like that quest is too hard, switch to a
        <br>
        lower Division(preferably 12).
        <br>
 <br>
 Once you reach Semi-Grade 2, you cannot just continue to do normal quests and rank up. You will be required to
        <br>
        also grip a certain amount of members of the other factions (quincy or arrancar, visored do not count since they
        <br>
        are still shinigami), along with regular and division quests.
        <br>
        <br>
<h3>Grade 2</h3>
After reaching grade 2 you will be required to obtain your Shikai to continue grading up.
<br>
Once you obtain your Shikai, continue to do normal missions, division quests, and quincy/arrancar grips until Semi-Grade 1
<br>
<br>(If you would like to check your progress, there is a hospital in K-Town where you can pay 1,000 Yen to check what other things you must do before ranking up)
<h3>Semi Grade 1-Elite Grade</h3>
After you completed your shikai fight, you continue to do board missions, division quests, and quincy/arrancar
<br>grips until you reach elite grade. If you are struggling to get the grips required, it is recommended to farm a friend
<br>of an opposing faction until you grade up. (If grips were the last part you need for a grade increase, you can
<br>continue to do more to reach the required amount for the next grade increase, but you cannot do more beyond
<br>that).
<h3 id="bankai">Bankai</h3>
<h3 id="obtain">Bankai will be obtained after defeated the bankai and successfully getting a screen that says "THE BLADE IS ME"
</h3>
Your bankai fight will be very hard. Depending on what type of shikai you have, the greater rarity, the harder it is
<br>If you fight your Bankai and lose at any point, you will be sent back to the real world and placed on cooldown for 1
<br>hour. To rid this cooldown, kill any other player from opposing races(Arrancar/Quincy)  
<br>The best way to beat your bankai is to use your critical move (R on computer, L2 on console, Crit button on mobile ),
<br>using a damaging move, then flashstep backwards, repeat. Depending on your element you will need to account
<br>for additional attacks, such as Ice's AoE freeze move, which you can just flashstep away from, or Blood's ranged
<br>move, which can be parried. This is one of the best cheese methods, as there are others but they are usually
<br>patched within a couple days of discovery.
<br>
<br>If you don't care, and are struggling with your bankai fight, you can do two things. The first is roll your weapon to
<br>get twinblade, the twinblade bankai's crit is a counter move, and the AI automatically tries to blockbreak using a
<br>heavy attack. When in a sticky situation hold block, it will try to blockbreak using its heavy, but will enter the
<br>counter stance instead. Once it does this flash step back. Another thing you can do is respec fully into speed
<br>(obviously don't use skill boxes unless you plan on staying as a speed build). Speed has a lot of moves that after
<br>you blockbreak, will allow you to get a quick stun move off and give you time to flash step away. The best strategy
<br>to use when doing either of these, is to flash step back, it will follow and the moment it gets close to you use your
<br>heavy. It will try to block and get blockbroken, you can then use a speed move (if you spec into speed) and then
<br>flash step away. It will follow soon after, and rinse and repeat until you obtain your bankai.
<br>
<br>(While this is a better method, it doesn't make it easy by any standards, so good luck)
