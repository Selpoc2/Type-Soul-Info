        <h1>Stage 1</h1>
        <p>To complete Stage 1 you have to complete one of the following</p>
        <p>7 Clan War wins</p>
        <p>13 Raid Wins</p>
        <p>20 ranked wins</p>
        <p>( there may also be a 4th way with like 20 hours spent in ranked im not sure)</p>
        <p>Your progress in this step can be tracked with an npc in karakura town. This npc has multiple text boxes depending on your completion</p>
        <p>"You will never become anything compared to what I am." - 0-19% completion</p>
        <p>"A couple of kills won't get you anywhere. Stop bothering me." - 20-39% completion</p>
        <p>"Why do you keep coming back? You're still pathetic." - 40-59% completion</p>
        <p>"Maybe you're not so bad after all. But I'm still not impressed." - 60-79% completion</p>
        <p>"You're quite unbelievable; do you know that?" - 80-99% completion</p>
        <p>"Unequaled. Unrivaled. Go make me proud, lil bro." - 100% completion</p>

    <div id="stage2">
<h1>Stage 2</h1>

<p>To complete Stage 2, you must complete the following without dying.</p>

<p>Grip 15 Elite-Grade players of an opposing faction (Quincy or Arrancar)</p>

<p>Kill 1 World Boss (Jidanbo, Bawabawa, or [that one angel from evangelion])</p>

<p>Kill 80 Hollows</p>

<h3>Dying while in Stage 2 or 2.5 will reset your Stage 2 Progress.</h3>
</div>

<div id="Stage2.5">
<p>You must go to Karakura town and talk to Kisuke. He will transport you to a minigame in a room with multiple swords.  </p>
<p>To win you need to find the 3 swords that are the real ones, the rest are fake.</p>
<p>You only have a couple chances to choose a fake sword before the game is over. </p>
<p>If you do choose a fake sword it will create a fleeting blue trail that will show you the direction of one of the real ones. </p>

<h3>If you fail the minigame you have to wait 15 minutes, or to negate the wait time you can grip a Quincy or Arrancar</h3>
</div>
<div id="Stage3">
<h1>Stage 3</h1>
    
<p>this step is very similar to unlocking Shikai but much harder

</p>

<p>you meditate and will have to fight your NPC but they will be using bankai. if you beat them you</p>

<p>will have unlocked bankai.</p>

<p>if you lose you have to wait for 1 hour, or you can skip this by again gripping either a quincy or</p>

<p>arancar.</p>
